/**
 * FIXTURE — a CONFORMANT egress reader, house-idiom-faithful to the real agent /
 * agent-gateway base-URL resolution pattern (the gateway-choke-point policy: "the per-customer LLM choke
 * point"): `(explicit-override || env-override || DEFAULT).replace(trailing-slash)`, then a
 * template-built URL, then a bare `fetch(...)` call.
 *
 * The DEFAULT constant resolves to `localhost` (a governed host in this fixture's blueprint),
 * so this reader is GREEN: the resolver follows the `||`-chain fold, finds the literal DEFAULT
 * operand, resolves its host, and confirms it is governed. Proves the real-shaped readers stay
 * green FOR THE RIGHT REASON — the host was resolved AND matched the allowlist, not silently
 * skipped.
