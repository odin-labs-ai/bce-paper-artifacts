/**
 * FIXTURE — a DRIFTED Luna chat extension: it is a recognizable extension factory, but it
 * NEVER registers its tool through the governed `pi.registerTool(...)` path. Instead it pushes
 * onto some ad-hoc array — bypassing the harness (and therefore the tool-access class, budget,
 * and audit the governed path enforces).
 *
 * This is exactly the implementation drift a blueprint gate must catch on a contributor's PR:
 * the extension "works" and typechecks, but it side-steps the governed registration. The
 * `luna-chat-extension` blueprint scores this RED (requiredDependency: a `provides` edge is
 * missing → a violation at the constraint severity).
