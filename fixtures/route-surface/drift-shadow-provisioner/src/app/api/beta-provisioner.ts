 * SEEDED-DEFECT FIXTURE (rg-shadow-provisioner-file) — a parallel `*-provisioner.ts` written as

 * built for, per the 0.8.0 comment in report.ts). The catch fires via `coverage.scannedFiles`
 * (component `file:src/app/api/beta-provisioner.ts`), NOT via any extracted component — proving
 * the raw-file tooth specifically. d6 / forbiddenPath / forbiddenPattern all stay green here.
